# Verified patch packages

Calcufolio patch packages automate the complete local workflow around a code
change. The package is treated as an auditable build input rather than an
unstructured archive.

## Apply a package

Place the ZIP archive in `~/Téléchargements`, then run:

```bash
make patch PATCH=calcufolio-live-result-preview-01
```

The runner performs these operations:

1. locates the requested ZIP archive;
2. rejects unsafe ZIP paths, links, encryption, duplicates, and oversized data;
3. extracts the package into an isolated directory below `logs/patches/`;
4. validates `manifest.json`, every declared file, extensions, UTF-8 content,
   JSON syntax, per-file SHA-256 values, and `SHA256SUMS`;
5. verifies the repository root, start branch, required paths, exact Git status,
   and expected modification count;
6. records `git diff --check`, `git status --short`, and diff statistics;
7. creates or verifies the target work branch;
8. executes the package `apply.sh` entrypoint;
9. verifies the exact post-application status and changed paths;
10. stages only manifest-authorized paths;
11. executes every validation command even when an earlier validation fails;
12. optionally runs the application and asks for explicit acceptance;
13. generates the commit message from manifest header, body, and footer fields;
14. creates and verifies the signed commit;
15. runs post-commit validation and verifies the final repository state.

A failure preserves the repository state for investigation. The runner does not
use `git reset --hard` and does not delete user work.

## Logs

Every execution creates:

```text
logs/patches/YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<patch-name>/
├── console.log
├── events.jsonl
├── summary.json
├── commands/
├── snapshots/
└── work/
```

Console messages use this structure:

```text
[time][PATCH][step/total][progress][stage][level][elapsed] message
```

Colors are enabled only for an interactive terminal. Set `NO_COLOR=1` to
disable them. Command output is prefixed and stored in a dedicated file.

## Manifest structure

The manifest records:

- patch name and description;
- project and repository identity;
- expected start and end branches;
- branch type, name, creation policy, and base reference;
- every package file with kind, non-empty requirement, and SHA-256 checksum;
- exact or subset-based Git status before and after application;
- required repository paths and expected changed paths;
- validation commands;
- manual application test policy;
- exact staging paths;
- signed commit header, body, footer, and execution mode;
- post-commit validation commands.

Use `scripts/patch/templates/manifest.json` as the starting point.

## Build a package

Prepare a directory whose name matches `patch.name`. Include `manifest.json`,
`apply.sh`, and every payload file declared by `package.files`. Checksum fields
may initially be empty.

```bash
make patch-pack \
  PATCH_DIR=/path/to/calcufolio-live-result-preview-01 \
  PATCH_OUTPUT=$HOME/Téléchargements/calcufolio-live-result-preview-01.zip
```

The packer computes manifest checksums, creates `SHA256SUMS`, validates the
complete directory, and produces a ZIP with exactly one top-level directory.

Validate without packing:

```bash
make patch-validate PATCH_DIR=/path/to/package
```

Run workflow tests:

```bash
make patch-self-test
```

## Interactive controls

- `PATCH_ASSUME_YES=1`: answer yes to prompts;
- `PATCH_NON_INTERACTIVE=1`: reject prompts that require user input;
- `NO_COLOR=1`: disable console colors;
- `PATCH_DOWNLOADS_DIR=/path`: override `~/Téléchargements`.

A required manual test always blocks the commit when it is skipped or rejected.
